# Docker redis

![build](https://github.com/bencgreen/docker-redis/workflows/build/badge.svg)

I've been using [webhippie](https://github.com/dockhippie/redis)'s MariaDB image for a while, but I wanted to use the latest version of [redis](https://redis.io/), and have a little more control over the image.

There are no volumes or environment variables yet - though I may add some in the future.
